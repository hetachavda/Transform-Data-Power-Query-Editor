# 📊 Data Warehousing & Visualization – Final Project

This repository contains my final project for **Winter 2025 – Data Warehousing & Visualization** at the **University of Niagara Falls**.  
It covers **predictive** and **prescriptive analytics** using **Power BI, Python, and statistical methods**, applied to real-world datasets.

## 🚀 Project Components

### 🔹 1. Bike Sharing Analysis :contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}
- **Objective**: Perform predictive & prescriptive analysis on bike rental data to uncover demand patterns and optimize operations.  
- **Key Features**:
  - Seasonal and weather-based rental trends
  - Feature engineering (time, weather, user behavior)
  - Skewness, outlier detection, and transformations
  - Exported **cleaned dataset** for Power BI dashboards
- **Tools**: Python (EDA & preprocessing), Power BI (dashboards), DAX, Power Query

---

### 🔹 2. House Prices Analysis :contentReference[oaicite:3]{index=3}
- **Objective**: Predict house prices using advanced statistical and ML techniques.  
- **Key Features**:
  - Data preprocessing (handling missing values & outliers)
  - Feature engineering (location, size, amenities)
  - Predictive modeling with regression & visualization
  - Insights for real estate decision-making
- **Tools**: Python (Pandas, Scikit-learn), Power BI (visual reports)

---

### 🔹 3. Visualization & Dashboarding
- Interactive dashboards in **Power BI**
- Prescriptive insights for decision support
- Business-ready visuals (seasonal demand, pricing strategies, KPI tracking)

---

## ⚙️ Tools & Technologies
- **Languages**: Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn)
- **Visualization**: Power BI, DAX, Power Query
- **Data**: Bike Sharing Dataset, Housing Market Dataset
- **Other**: Excel/CSV for preprocessing

---

## ✨ Key Insights
- **Bike Sharing**: Rentals are highly influenced by season, weather, and weekdays. Demand peaks during summer and working days.  
- **House Prices**: Location, size, and amenities are primary drivers of property value. Predictive models improve pricing strategies.  
- **Prescriptive Takeaway**: Businesses can optimize resources, improve pricing, and enhance customer satisfaction by leveraging data-driven decisions.
